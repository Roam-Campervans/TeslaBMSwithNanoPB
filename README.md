# TeslaBMSwithNanoPB
Based on [Collin80/teslaBMS] (https://github.com/collin80/TeslaBMS) repository I,but have added Protocol buffers with the NanoBP library for embedded systems.
My hopes and goals are to take the data from the BMS and pass it using protocol buffers to DynamoDB over GSM network, then to an android application.





## Goals:
1. Get a Proto buff message back for my Pack.
2. Add a touchscreen in order to take in User information about the pack and store in the message
3. Get the android app /web app reciving and displaying the message
